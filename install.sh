# Builds SuperHackerGolf and copies the DLL into the game's MelonLoader Mods folder.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - MelonLoader must be installed into the game folder first
#     (run Installer/MelonLoader.x64.zip via Proton, or unzip MelonLoader.x64.zip
#      into the game folder and launch once so MelonLoader generates its dirs)
#   - Unity reference DLLs are read from the game's Managed folder at build time
#   - r2modman's BepInEx winhttp.dll should be removed or the game should be
#     launched directly via Steam (not through r2modman) so MelonLoader's
#     version.dll proxy gets loaded instead.
